            <b>Agile Wit</b>
            is a program that helps to develop a witty sense of humor - one of the most valuable life skills
            we may have.
            <br />
            A well-placed quality joke can win us a date, a new friend, a job interview, or a business
            contract.
            <br />
            Humor gains allies, disarms enemies, and makes us convincing and charming, regardless of the
            shortcomings of our personality or physical appearance.
            <br />
            <br />
            A witty sense of humor indicates a high-grade intellect, without intimidating others at the same
            time.
            <br />
            According to conventional wisdom, it is a natural talent.
            <br />
            In fact, just like improving your memory or your vocabulary, wit and humor can be trained.
            <br />
            <br />
            Wit and humor use advanced creative thinking – the ability to assemble existing concepts into
            something refreshingly new.
            <br />
            Humor compliments logic - like a latchkey, it opens doors logic can't.
            <br />
            Logic:
            <i>“If A then B”</i>
            <br />
            Humor:
            <i>“Make ay while the sun shines”</i>
            <br />
            <br />
            <i>“Wit is the sudden marriage of ideas which, before their union, were not perceived to have any
                relation”
            </i>
            <br />
            -Mark Twain.
            <br />
            The new idea must be related to the original concept, otherwise, it’s just gibberish.
            <br />
            <br />
            The ability to create witty quips goes beyond social life interactions.
            <br />
            Creativity means abandoning the automatic mode of thinking - the reiteration of the first cliche
            that instinctively comes to our mind.
            <br />
            True creativity = true intelligence, where intelligence may be defined as the ability to solve any
            problem that we encounter.
            <br />
            Humor is creativity served as an enjoyable dish.
            <br />
            <br />
            Humor can be found anywhere:
            <br />
            Monday morning at work, numbly staring at the monitor:
            <br />
            <i>“I am either on the beach in Maui, or I forgot the password to my Bitcoin account”</i>
            <br />
            The waiting room at the dentist:
            <br />
            <i>“Count Dracula will see you next”</i>
            <br />
            Even watching the paint dry:
            <br />
            <i>“The Wall by Pink Floyd was definitely not a dry album”</i>
            <br />
            <br />
            Humor comes in many shapes and forms - “delivery vehicles”.
            <br />
            Mastering all of them would be difficult, but it’s not necessary.
            <br />
            We don’t need to know how to operate a submarine, an airliner, a hang-glider, and a unicycle.
            <br />
            Knowing how to drive a car and ride a bicycle is usually enough.
            <br />
            The vehicle of choice in the <b>Agile Wit</b> program is the 1-liner Joke (Quip) – brief and
            effective.
            <br />
            <br />
            Every Joke is a response to a Setup (a statement, or a situation/event).
            <br />
            Example: Your coworker Jeff walks into the conference room and leaves the door wide open behind
            him.
            <br />
            <i>“Jeff, pull your tail inside and close the door!"</i>
            <br />
            <br />
            The Scene (Story) is the 1st of the 3 key components of a joke.
            <br />
            The 1-liner joke works by creating a scene (or a very short story) that plays in the imagination
            of the audience.
            <br />
            Example: A Roman legionnaire walks into the bar, holds up 2 fingers, and says:
            <br />
            <i>“Five beers please”</i>
            <br />
            <br />
            Surprise is the 2nd key component of a joke.
            <br />
            In a joke, we hear something different than what we expected.
            <br />
            It must be somehow related to the setup, otherwise, it’s just nonsense.
            <br />
            Example: A frantic mother runs into the doctor’s office
            <br />
            <i>“Doctor, please help! My little Johnny just swallowed his ball-point pen!”</i>.
            <br />
            Doctor:
            <i>“No reason to panic ma’am. For now, he can write with a pencil”
            </i>
            <br />
            <br />
            Misfortune/Mischief is the 3rd component of a joke.
            <br />
            Not every joke uses misfortune/mischief, but the best ones often do.
            <br />
            <i>Example: “I will never forget the last words my grandfather said to me just before he passed
                away:”
                <br />
                “’Are you still holding that ladder?!’”
            </i>
            <br />
            <br />
            Every joke has a Target.
            <br />
            Usually, it is either a person or a situation/event.
            <br />
            Sometimes it can also be an animal or an object
            <br />
            In self-deprecating jokes, the target is one specific person – ourselves.
            <br />
            If possible, using a non-person target may deliver a good joke without risking anyone’s anger.
            <br />
            <br />
            To summarize:
            <br />
            A Joke is a Surprising Scene/Story often spiced with Misfortune/Mischief.
            <br />
