        <b>Agile Wit</b>
        is a program that helps to develop a witty sense of humor - one of the most valuable life skills we
        may have.
        <br />
        A well-placed quality joke can win us a date, a new friend, a job interview, or a business contract.
        <br />
        Humor gains allies, disarms enemies, and makes us convincing and charming, regardless of the
        shortcomings of our personality or physical appearance.
        <br />
        <br />
        A witty sense of humor indicates a high-grade intellect, without intimidating others at the same time.
        <br />
        According to conventional wisdom, it is a natural talent.
        <br />
        In fact, just like improving your memory or your vocabulary, wit and humor can be trained.
        <br />
        <br />
        Wit and humor use advanced creative thinking - the ability to assemble existing concepts into
        something refreshingly new.
        <br />
        Humor compliments logic - like a latchkey, it opens doors logic can't.
        <br />
        Logic:
        <i>"If A then B"</i>
        <br />
        Humor:
        <i>"Make ay while the sun shines"</i>
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>"Wit is the sudden marriage of ideas which, before their union, were not perceived to have any
          relation"
        </i>
        <br />
        -Mark Twain.
        <br />
        The new idea must be related to the original concept, otherwise, it's just gibberish.
        <br />
        <br />
        The ability to create witty quips goes beyond social life interactions.
        <br />
        Creativity means abandoning the automatic mode of thinking - the reiteration of the first cliche that
        instinctively comes to our mind.
        <br />
        True creativity = true intelligence, where intelligence may be defined as the ability to solve any
        problem that we encounter.
        <br />
        Humor is creativity served as an enjoyable dish.
        <br />
        <br />
        Humor can be found anywhere:
        <br />
        Monday morning at work, numbly staring at the monitor:
        <br />
        <i>"I am either on the beach in Maui, or I forgot the password to my Bitcoin account"</i>
        <br />
        The waiting room at the dentist:
        <br />
        <i>"Count Dracula will see you next"</i>
        <br />
        Even watching the paint dry:
        <br />
        <i>"The Wall by Pink Floyd was definitely not a dry album"</i>
        <br />
        <br />
        Humor comes in many shapes and forms - "delivery vehicles".
        <br />
        Mastering all of them would be difficult, but it's not necessary.
        <br />
        We don't need to know how to operate a submarine, an airliner, a hang-glider, and a unicycle.
        <br />
        Knowing how to drive a car and ride a bicycle is usually enough.
        <br />
        The vehicle of choice in the <b>Agile Wit</b> program is the 1-liner Joke (Quip) - brief and
        effective.
        <br />
        <br />
        Every Joke is a response to a Setup (a statement, or a situation/event).
        <br />
        Example: Your coworker Jeff walks into the conference room and leaves the door wide open behind him.
        <br />
        <i>"Jeff, pull your tail inside and close the door!"</i>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Scene (Story) is the 1st of the 3 key components of a joke.
        <br />
        The 1-liner joke works by creating a scene (or a very short story) that plays in the imagination of
        the audience.
        <br />
        Example: A Roman legionnaire walks into the bar, holds up 2 fingers, and says:
        <br />
        <i>"Five beers please"</i>
        <br />
        <br />
        Surprise is the 2nd key component of a joke.
        <br />
        In a joke, we hear something different than what we expected.
        <br />
        It must be somehow related to the setup, otherwise, it's just nonsense.
        <br />
        Example: A frantic mother runs into the doctor's office
        <br />
        <i>"Doctor, please help! My little Johnny just swallowed his ball-point pen!"</i>.
        <br />
        Doctor:
        <i>"No reason to panic ma'am. For now, he can write with a pencil"
        </i>
        <br />
        <br />
        Misfortune/Mischief is the 3rd component of a joke.
        <br />
        Not every joke uses misfortune/mischief, but the best ones often do.
        <br />
        <i>Example: "I will never forget the last words my grandfather said to me just before he passed away:"
          <br />
          "'Are you still holding that ladder?!'"
        </i>
        <br />
        <br />
        Every joke has a Target.
        <br />
        Usually, it is either a person or a situation/event.
        <br />
        Sometimes it can also be an animal or an object
        <br />
        In self-deprecating jokes, the target is one specific person - ourselves.
        <br />
        If possible, using a non-person target may deliver a good joke without risking anyone's anger.
        <br />
        <br />
        To summarize:
        <br />
        A Joke is a Surprising Scene/Story often spiced with Misfortune/Mischief.
        <br />
